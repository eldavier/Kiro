# Current Mission State

> This file tracks the **running state** of the active mission. The Orchestrator updates it after each agent interaction.
> It serves as a persistent checkpoint so context is never lost, even on very long missions.
> **This file is overwritten each mission** — it is NOT append-only like other memory files.
