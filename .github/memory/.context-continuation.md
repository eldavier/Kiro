# Context Continuation State

> This file enables **seamless context handoffs** when an agent session approaches its token limit.
> The Orchestrator writes this before ending a session. The next session reads it to resume exactly where it left off.
> **This file is overwritten each handoff** — only the latest continuation matters.
