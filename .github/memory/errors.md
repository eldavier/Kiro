# Error Patterns & Fixes

> Persistent memory for errors encountered, their root causes, and verified fixes.
> **You can edit this file directly** — add known issues, correct agent entries, or remove resolved ones.
> Agents will check this before debugging to avoid re-discovering known issues.

<!-- Agents: append new entries below using the format:
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Error Summary
- **Mission**: mission-id
- **Agent**: which agent encountered/fixed this
- **Error**: exact error message or description
- **Root cause**: what caused it
- **Fix**: what resolved it
- **Prevention**: how to avoid this in the future
