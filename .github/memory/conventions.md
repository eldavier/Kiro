# Codebase Conventions

> Persistent memory for coding conventions, style rules, naming patterns, and best practices discovered in this codebase.
> **You can edit this file directly** — add your own rules, correct agent entries, or remove outdated ones.
> Agents will read this before writing code and append new conventions as they are discovered.
