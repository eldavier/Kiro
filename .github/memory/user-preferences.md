# User Preferences

> Persistent memory for user preferences, working style, and explicit instructions that should persist across all missions.
> **This is YOUR file** — edit it freely to add preferences, rules, or instructions. Everything here is treated as authoritative.
> Agents will also record your instructions here when you tell them something important during a mission.
